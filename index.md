# Christopher Roman - A Journey in Web Development

My entire career has been in customer service. From the day I started working in a grocery store to my first day working in a hotel. I've spent more than half of my life in a career focused on helping people get what they need.

This next step. This new journey. This life changing opportunity is something I am incredibly excited about. I can't wait to see what the future holds for me and my family!

## Goals

- Learn Everything I Can in the WDI
- Build a Strong Network
- Document this Journey
- Land a Remote Web Development Job

## Plan

- Put together weekly updates on my progress
- List out learnings from MeetUps I attend before, during, and after graduation
- Offer guidance to anyone who has questions about this process
